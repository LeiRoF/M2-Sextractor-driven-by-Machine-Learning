- Continued to watch [object detection AI tutorial on youtubee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U)
- Found [collection of models based on TensorFlow 2.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) with indication of accuracy, speed and output type.
  - Assuming that we are searching for accuracy, not speed
  - "**CenterNet HourGlass104 Keypoints 1024x1024**" model got the higher score on COCO 2017 dataset.
